* introduce
This is my personal emacs configuration. It is highly inspired by doom emacs.

I use doom-emacs for mostly 3 months. then I think maybe I can configure emacs from scratch by myself for fun.

* directory structure
The Emacs configuration is placed in [[file:.emacs.d/][.emacs.d]] folder.

- init file
